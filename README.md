# Pisco Code

A way to show decimal or hexadecimal values using a single LED or a vibrator device. In addition, these values can be displayed as positive or negative when needed.

# Why

How many times in developing some microcontroller project, do we miss a simple mechanism to display variable values? Of course, in some projects, we already have a serial output, debug tools or even a display that we can use in the early stages of the project! However, this is not always what we have.

At other times, we miss a simple and intuitive mechanism. For example, people who perform field maintenance on the hardware we are developing, can read values from internal registers, to facilitate diagnosis.

# The Simple and Current way to Implement this

Currently, in most cases, we develop some blinking patterns on the status LEDs to indicate certain conditions in the software have been reached.
To demonstrate numerical values between 1 and 20, for example, we can blink a status LED x times, indicating the desired value.

Another approach I found for larger numbers were creating sequences of blinks.

Status LED showing the code 312 using a sequence of blinks.

This approach works well for pre-defined codes that do not have a zero digit. It would be tricky to show the code 302, for example, and expect the observer to notice a more significant gap between the digits 3 and 2, thus concluding that it would be 302

The basic idea of this project is to create a mechanism to display digits, using a sequence of blinks like above, but with the possibility of also showing the zero number.

# Egg of Columbus

As can be seen in the graphic below, the working principle of the Pisco Code is practically the same. The only difference is that before starting the blinking sequence, the LED will be partially on and it is turned off only after the code has all been "displayed".

This simple change makes the code easier to read, allowing the observer to know when the sequence starts. For example, when the LED is off and remains dimmed for a few seconds and starts blinking, the observer knows that a new series has just begun.

# The Origin of Zero

In addition to the benefit mentioned above, this solution also created the possibility of representing the zero digit, in any position of the code to be displayed.
For example, in the graphic below, code 120 is shown. As you can see, once the sequence of codes starts with the LED partially on, the blinks with maximum brightness show numbers between 1-9 while a single blink, turning off the LED, signals the digit zero.

![Pisco-Code-120-144x144.gif](https://github.com/pisco-de-luz/Pisco-Code/blob/ba3e80ebc5cc06cf77d8f8e30f36b71e3b5d880f/graphics/Pisco-Code-120-144x144.gif)

Sometimes, depending on the type of information we will show, it is necessary to guarantee a minimum number of digits. 

For example, when we need to show the voltage value in the range of 0 - 5v with two decimal places like 0.02 volts, it is crucial to set the minimum number of the digit to 3. 

With this method, we will infer where the decimal point is.

# Binary and Hexadecimal Values

Using the Pisco Code system, it would be easy to implement variations to display binary (0 and 1) or even hexadecimal (0 - 15) values. But, of course, the sequence would probably contain more digits for binary numbers. In contrast, each digit could have many blinks for hexadecimal numbers, making it a little harder to read them.

For decimal numbers, this system has been used by the [Pisco de Luz](https://www.piscodeluz.org/?lang=en) project since 2020, working very well. They use it to read the number of hours of lighting already used, battery/solar board voltage, temperature and much more.

# The Negative Side

As some variables can contain negative values, in their case the temperature inside of the device, it was necessary to create a mechanism to distinguish a positive number from a negative one. The idea was to create a long blink at the beginning of the sequence to signal the dash of the negative sign. After this blink, the digit-by-digit process begins.

Below is an example of the value -12 being shown. Note the long blink at the beginning.

# Usage

```C++
#include "Pisco-Code.h"

PiscoCode      ledBuiltin;                                        // declare an object of class PiscoCode
bool           ledBuiltinOK;                                      // It is safe to show codes with ledBuiltin?

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);                                   // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.                  
  if ( ledBuiltinOK = ledBuiltin.setup(&turnLedOnOff) ) {         // calling the PiscoCode class constructor.
     ledBuiltin.showCode(1024, static_cast<uint8_t>(pisco::NumberBase::DECIMAL));               // display the 1024 number on BUILTIN led.  
  }
}

void loop() {
   if ( ledBuiltinOK && ! ledBuiltin.isSequencing() ) {           // If ledBuiltin was set up and is not sequencing any code
      ledBuiltin.showCode(millis()/1000, PiscoCode::HEXADECIMAL); // display some number on BUILTIN led repeatedly.    
   }
   ledBuiltin.loop(millis());                                     // We should call the LOOP function regularly.

   // run other non-blocking function here
}

// Before using this function to turn the LED on and off, the setup method will check if it is a valid
// pointer to a correct function, and it should respond to a LED_FUNC_OK call returning true. 
//
// This function will return true only if one of these three commands are received, LED_ON,
// LED_OFF, and LED_FUNC_OK. All other values will return false. 
bool turnLedOnOff(uint8_t ctrlLED) {
  bool funcOK = true;
  if ( ctrlLED == LED_ON ) {              digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  } else if ( ctrlLED == LED_OFF ) {      digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  
  } else if ( ctrlLED != LED_FUNC_OK ) {  funcOK = false; }
  return( funcOK );
}
```
# Using on Arduino IDE
To install, copy the Pisco-Code folder into your arduino sketchbook-libraries folder. More detailed instruction are [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

# Basic Configuration
You first need to include the header file and create one or more PiscoCode objects to use this library.

## Initial Class setup

```C++
#include "Pisco-Code.h"

PiscoCode      ledOne;         // declare an object of class PiscoCode
PiscoCode      ledTwo;         // declare an object of class PiscoCode
```

Before we call the setup method, we have to create a local function that will be passed as a pointer to work as a layer abstraction to the hardware that we 
will use to turn the LED on and off. 

## Functions of Hardware Abstraction Examples

This function should return TRUE only if one of these three commands are received, pisco::LED_ON, pisco::LED_OFF, and pisco::LED_FUNC_OK. All other values should return FALSE. 

When the caller passes pisco::LED_ON, the function should turn the LED on and return TRUE if everything works well. Likewise, when the caller passes pisco::LED_OFF, it should turn the LED off and return TRUE.


```C++
bool turnLed1_OnOff(uint8_t ctrlLED) {
  bool funcOK = true;
  if ( ctrlLED == pisco::LED_ON ) {              digitalWrite(LED1_PORT, HIGH);
  } else if ( ctrlLED == pisco::LED_OFF ) {      digitalWrite(LED1_PORT, LOW);  
  } else if ( ctrlLED != pisco::LED_FUNC_OK ) {  funcOK = false; }
  return( funcOK );
}

bool turnLed2_OnOff(uint8_t ctrlLED) {
  bool funcOK = true;
  if ( ctrlLED == pisco::LED_ON ) {              digitalWrite(LED2_PORT, HIGH);
  } else if ( ctrlLED == pisco::LED_OFF ) {      digitalWrite(LED2_PORT, LOW);  
  } else if ( ctrlLED != pisco::LED_FUNC_OK ) {  funcOK = false; }
  return( funcOK );
}
```

## Calling the Object setup() function.

The setup() function has two main task. The first one is to register the pointer to the hardware abstraction function into PiscoCode::LedOnOff private variable. The second task is to certify that the pointer is valid and it is pointing to a function that seems to be working as it should. 

It receives a pointer to this abstraction function and returns TRUE if everything works ok. Otherwise, it returns FALSE, indicating that the setup process of this object failed. 

```C++
// Global variables
bool           ledOneOK;       // It is safe to show codes with ledOne?
bool           ledTwoOK;       // It is safe to show codes with ledTwo?

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED1_PORT, OUTPUT);                                 // initialize digital pin LED1_PORT as an output.                  
  pinMode(LED2_PORT, OUTPUT);                                 // initialize digital pin LED2_PORT as an output.    
  ledOneOK = ledOne.setup(&turnLed1_OnOff);                   // calling the PiscoCode setup function.
  ledTwoOK = ledTwo.setup(&turnLed2_OnOff);                   // calling the PiscoCode setup function.
}
```

## Showing PiscoCodes, calling showCode() Function
The showCode() function needs two arguments, the "code-to-show" and the "base" to use. It will return three possible status codes.


### Arguments

| Argument               | Description                                            |
| :---:                  | :---                                                   |
| code-to-show (int32_t) | Integer number between -9999999999 and 9999999999 to show in the LED that was set up during this object initialization.  |
| base (uint8_t)         | This function will show the code passed in the first argument using one of the following base systems. PiscoCode::BINARY, PiscoCode::OCTAL, static_cast<uint8_t>(pisco::NumberBase::DECIMAL) or PiscoCode::HEXADECIMAL  |

### Status Code Returned

| Status Code            | Description                                            |
| :---:                  | :---                                                   |
| OK                     | This function accepted the code-to-show and base passed as arguments and will start showing the code shortly. |
| SEQUENCE_RUNNING       | This function is still working in the previous code and can not accept any new tasks. |
| FAILED                 | Something went wrong, and this function failed to accept this code. |

### Simple calling Examples

```C++
// If we could start showing Pisco Code 1024 on ledOne
if ( ledOne.showCode(1024, static_cast<uint8_t>(pisco::NumberBase::DECIMAL)) == static_cast<uint8_t>(pisco::status_t::OK) ) {
   // Do something
} 
// Trying to start showing Pisco Code 13 in binary on ledTwo 
uint8_t statusLedTwo = ledTwo.showCode(13, PiscoCode::BINARY);
// If we could not
if ( statusLedTwo != static_cast<uint8_t>(pisco::status_t::OK) ) {
   // Do something
}
```

### Custom Settings
Before calling the showCode() function, it is possible to change some characteristics to fit your needs better. 

The LED could have sixteen bright levels using a PWM-controlled software mechanism. From zero (less bright) to 15 (maximum bright). We need to set two brightness levels to Pisco Code works, one for the dimmed phase and another for the blink phase. 

When creating the Pisco Code object, these values are zero and fifteen, respectively. 

We can use these two functions below to change it.

```C++
ledOne.setDimPwm(3);    // Define the new value of default dimmed pwm. 
ledOne.setPwm(10);      // Define the new value of default pwm.
```

We can also change the others two options, the minimum number of digits to show and how many times the Pisco Code should repeat. 

In the example below, we will set the Pisco Code to have at least four digits and repeat it twice. 

```C++
// Define how many times the code should repeat. As we set it to one, indicate that we want it to show twice.
ledOne.setRepeat(1);       

// Define the minimum number of digits to show. If the code is 12, the system will show 0012.
ledOne.setMinDigits(4);    
```

## More Public Functions

### isSequencing()

As some Pisco Code are big or need to be repeated many times, it could take a while to finish the whole process. 
So, we create a function to check if the current process is still running or has already been finished. 

```C++
if ( ! ledOne.isSequencing() ) {   // If ledOne is not sequencing any more
                                   // We can call ledOne.showCode() again to show new values
}
```

The Pisco Code is a nom blocking library that works using three main functions. 

The first one is setup() that we have to call as soon as we want to start using our object.
After that, the second most crucial function is loop(). We should call it repeatedly at least 1000 times per second.  
The last function we need to call is showCode(), the function that starts the whole sequencing of blinks to show the desired code. 

As we have already shown how to use the setup() and showCode() functions, now we will start describing the mechanisms behind the loop() process. 

### loop()

The loop() function is the most complex algorithm in the whole class. It manages all the timing and dimerization of the Pisco Code one LED blink system. Once the others functions finish passing the information necessary to show the Pisco Code, like brightness, code, base system, times to repeat, etc., it starts the whole sequencing process. 

As it is a nom blocking function, just a handful of line codes are executed and returned briefly. Each time it is called, based on the amount of time passed since the last call, the algorithm determines if it is necessary to turn the LED on, off, or do nothing. 

To assess whether it has to turn the LED on or off, this function works in phases where each phase has its own time to live mechanism.  

The diagram below shows how these phases and timing systems work.
